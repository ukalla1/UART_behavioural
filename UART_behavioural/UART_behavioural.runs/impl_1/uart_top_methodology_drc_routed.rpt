TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk]
